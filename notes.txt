seperate out functionality
--------------------------

            need to record head state - current points to where the repo is at (ignoring local modifications).

webserver - serve file requests for mounted repos
syncer - pull updated logs from the tracker
         queue downloads for files
         push new log files to the tracker

get it compiling again..
remove glog calls
modularise functions so they communicate with signals and slots

get tests finised for logger
get tests written for webserverx
write specs for syncer, downloader

consider how to make both command line and gui modes

consider node setup, daemons etc
