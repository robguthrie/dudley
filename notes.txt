Wow sync is almos tthere
a few things
settings management

Settings
    Client ip source
        Tracker - public ip or maybe proxy
        Manual - gah.. hopefully unnecessary
    Port
        UPNP or Manual

we can read the ip advertised to the tracker
this is called trac

I want to make a remote control feature possible now that we have a phone home system,
would be good to expose sshd via dudley if we wanted to, now that we can map ports


Synchroniser(repo, url)
    local_lognames = repo->logger->logNames()
    remote_lognames = get remote lognames from url


    sync a repo
        url to sync state against
        sync state
            QStringList server_state_diff_names
            QList<StateDiff> pulled_state_diffs
            pull
                request list of statediffs from server
                check for missing state diffs against repo state
                request missing state diffs and instanciate into pull_state_diffs
            push
                push state_diffs not listed in server_state_diff_names

            process pulled_state_diffs
                if download queue is empty..
                for oldest state_diff in pulled_state_diffs
                    for each state_op
                        if action == "add file" or "modify_file"
                            copy state op to download queue
                        if action =="rename"
                            do it
                        if action=="remove"
                            do that too (youch!)

    m_repos
    for each repo
