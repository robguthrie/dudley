use QUUID to give node a uid.
consider the table holding all f
build nodewide table of unique file ids, with frequency count,


ensure that httpclientfilerepo sorts the commitnames before loading them
and ensure that filrepologger sorts them before loading them too

getFile and putFile should take offset and length and the http server needs to
support range headers.. then we can resume downloads.. but i feel this is going
to be a source of problems unless i get it right..

test a big loop of httpclientfilerepos!!
